	\section{Project Purpose}
The purpose of the DSCVL project is to come up with an effective solution that is to paint an overlay image with a single point signal both from different kinds of technology. In fact, the solution uses the Lidar technology ( the solid-state rplidar) that shows better performance in the outdoor environment when is to detect, locate, and measure objects   including liquids and people by using sensors pulsing laser to reach its subject and does that with great accuracy than the infrared-based technology can do. For the IR though seems to provide exact measurements in the indoor environment, on the other hand, performs poorly outside. The second technology using the a camera in this case, the Logitech Brio Webcam would capture video stream to turn into images that would be combined to the point lidar points output. And finally, This entire process   would equip the  stakeholder specially the client of the DSCVL project with a tool to trace movements, see any subject of interest and precisely determine the distance of which the subject of interest is found.	


\section{Current State}
At the current stage,though the application to implement has not yet reached its ultimate goal that is to put in display an overlay image as required by the client, nonetheless i was able during the past ten weeks to do the following tasks:

\subsection{Progress- the project frontend}
The first place i got started was to write user python-based interface using what was for me a relevant python library known as the "appJar" library. However, over the course of the implementation, i ran into the issue of the documentation to keep on  working with appJar library to write some needed functions such as the events handlers routines. And that set me into a path to look for another library, in this case the tkinter library. And currently, this is the GUI i got ( see figure 1).\\

    	 \centering \includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=4000,natheight=200]{images/userinterface.png}
    	\caption{figure}{ Graphical user interface, python-based implimentation}\label{def:gui}
    	\end{figure}
    	
Afterward, i switched back and got involved in the backend of the project.

	\subsection{Progress-the project backend}
the part of the project, i am called to work in consist of writing functions to get data receive from the rplidar for example the rplidar A1 and change those data to be useful information to trace and  locate with precision any subject that the user could be interesting found within the application boundaries of computation. so far, i have written functions that allow to transform  rplidar device string of characters onto an array of values, another function to receive as input the previous array, compute and return another array of values providing the various angles as the subject moves along the Z-axis, and i can display data as shown by the following figure2:
\begin{figure}[ht]
    	 \includegraphics[width=6in,natwidth=2000,natheight=200]{images/output.png}
    	\caption{figure}{ data from the rplidar scanner device(leftside) \& outcomes from dynamic object function (rightside) of the figure}
    	\end{figure}
    	
    	\textbf{\textit{Associate code of execution of the above figure}â€¢}
    	
    	this code is a snippet code that describes how data  are processed.

    	\caption{figure}{  python-based code of execution}
    	\end{figure}

Additionally, having in mind that our application has to run on multiple plaforms namely Windows, MacOS and Linux, we are simultaneously  writing this application on Windows and Linux, and interchangeably tools from either of the  platforms mentioned above. 
I am Saying we is to mean, Lam and who work on the project.		
	
	\subsection{Group Evaluation}
		My teammate Lam, beyond the fact of being a hardworking guy, an excellent communicator, has an impressive skill of an organizer. From day one, Lam is committed himself to the project, engaging to it day in day out.
		under Lam leadership and in almost eight weeks, we have relentlessly pushed  boundaries, he always reviews and explores new of ways that could grant us the pathway to final solution.   project.
		though, we have not yet  reached the ultimate goal which is who have to have the overlay, paint image on the screen, Lam optimist, engagement, excellent work ethic and enthusiasm, self determination are all solid signs  that demonstrate that our project will get into its final stage.
		Honestly, Lam is a great teammate to work with and in the workplace if he keep on  working and displaying all the skills mentioned above, that will not be surprising to see him leading people. 
		
	Just to elaborate a little bit on Lam character, this is the kind of partner that when you work with, he is eager to provide useful information so that the project will move down to the path of its achievement.

	\section{Conclusion}	
	This winter progress report presents the history of the work done during the past ten weeks, clearly elaborates on the purpose and the current stage of the project, demonstrates the great, leading and humble qualities of Lam  my partner but still, i have to admit the fact that we do have head of us some miles to go and some hurdles to overcome,  before we see the final and expected  outcome that is to provide a working software that would eventually allow our client to review the type of image paint on the screen  and generally for stakeholders to evaluate and to harness the product.
